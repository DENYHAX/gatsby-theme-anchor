## Roadmap for the project in priority

The idea of the starter will be to have 4 pages:

- [Home](#Home): where will be the banner of the podcast with the latest episodes. This has to be most important page
- [Podcasts](#Podcasts): a simple list of all the published podcast, endless I would say ...
- [About](#About): This page will start using the CMS and here the author can use this page for whatever they want to say. Ideally inside the CMS I will use a Markdown text Editor and then here I can use mdx to render cool components that will go with the esthetic of the page.
- [News](#News): it will use the CMS and the idea is to show a bunch of posts that the author can do. This will be more or less like a newsletter section.

    A

    Theme to showcase your podcast in
    <a href="https://anchor.fm/">Anchor</a>
  </i>
</p>

[Live Demo](https://gatsby-theme-anchor.netlify.com/)

## Motivation ü§î

When a podcast starts the most difficult part is sharing it with the rest of world, this Gatsby Theme will help to solve that! The idea behind it is to provide a customizable platform where the podcasters can:

- Have a [Landing page](#landing) with the last episodes of the show and more relevant information.
- Add information about the show inside the [About Page](#About)
- Showcase all the podcast inside the [Podcast Page](#Podcast)
- Possibility to add/edit/remove content using a [CMS view](#CMS)

I recorded a really short podcast in which I talked about this project. So in case you want to know more about it and also listen to my first "real" podcast episode, I leave you the link!
